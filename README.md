# COMPSYS 302: Design: Software Practice
## Python Project - p2p Chat Application

### Steps to run:
1. Run setup.sh to create a vitrual environment and install necessary dependancies.
2. Run 'deactivate' in the shell to deactive the virtual env after you are finished with it.

### Notes
* The setup.sh script automatically starts the python program.
* If you wish to start it again please run 'python main.py' afterwards, whilst ensuring that the virtual env is still active. To reactivate the virtual env please run 'source my_virtualenv/bin/activate'
* The current prototype implementation project doesn't automatically refresh the page. Please manually refresh the page many times during testing of the prototype. This wasn't a top priority as the main aim of the project was backend development.
