# COMPSYS 302: Design: Software Practice
## Python Project - p2p Chat Application

### Steps to run:
1. Run setup.sh to create a vitrual environment and install necessary dependancies.
2. Run 'deactivate' in the shell to deactive the virtual env after you are finished with it.

### Supported Nodes:
Although this project has been developed with the interest of supporting all nodes in the netork, this is not possible to achieve due to the scale of the variations that can be caused by differing developers. The following are some of the clients that the developer has tested with:

* myep112
* abha808
* hone075
* jgud007
* ramo588

### Notes
* The setup.sh script automatically starts the python program.
* If you wish to start it again please run 'python main.py' afterwards, whilst ensuring that the virtual env is still active. To reactivate the virtual env please run 'source my_virtualenv/bin/activate'
* The current prototype implementation project doesn't automatically refresh the page. Please manually refresh the page many times during testing of the prototype. This wasn't a top priority as the main aim of the project was backend development.
